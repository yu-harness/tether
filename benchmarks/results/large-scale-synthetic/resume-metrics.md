## Resume Highlights
- Built a fixed benchmark harness with 12 tasks and automated pass/fail, verifier, and budget summaries.
- Recorded 3 run artifacts per execution and structured runtime metadata across 6 aggregated runs.
- Observed prompt-cache telemetry with average cached tokens of 0.0 and cache-hit rate of 0.00% when available.
- In a synthetic long-context stress scenario, context reduction shrank prompt size from 8208 to 6262 chars.
- In the memory dependency experiment, repeated follow-up reads dropped from 3 to 0.
- In the large-scale memory experiment, repeated reads dropped from 60 to 0 across 12 tasks.
